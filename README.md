# Anti Netease

We are opposed to NetEase agent [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft) in China Mainland.

Please **understand the following concepts** before continuing reading:
- China edition (also known as NetEase edition or china server): refers to the localized game edition launched by NetEase after the agent Minecraft in China Mainland.
- International edition (also known as original or international editon): refers to the editon of the Minecraft game officially released by Mojang (that is, the non-NetEase editon).

This project aims to:
- Encourage NetEase to open the download channel of the international editon in China Mainland and stop its monopoly position (mainly).
- Let more China Mainland players play less of the China editon and more of the international editon (secondary).

## Why anti NetEase

From 2014 to 2016, it can be said that Minecraft has exploded all over the world. In that era, many Minecraft communities and platforms were also born in mainland China. In 2016, NetEase obtained the right to represent Minecraft in Mainland China. In 2017, NetEase launched the China Edition of Minecraft and broke the way of Minecraft PE in mainland China. But the game experience of China Edition is very poor

NetEase caused the decline of Minecraft in mainland China, and also caused [Mini World](https://www.miniworldgame.com/) (Minecraft's biggest competitor in mainland China) has gradually increased in popularity.
